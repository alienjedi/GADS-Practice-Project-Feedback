- You provided 12 screenshots in your repository and therefore, you completed 12 labs.

- However, the following labs:

   - Lab1-Google Cloud Fundamentals Getting Started with Cloud Marketplace

   - Lab3-Cloud IAM

   - Lab5-Getting Started with GKE
   
   - Lab6-Implementing Cloud SQL

   - Lab7-Automating the Deployment of Infrastructure Using Terraform

   are the only labs that I can confirm were completed within the timeline of the program: **Friday, Aug 28 - Friday, Sep 11 2020 (2 Weeks)**


- All the other labs:

   - Lab4-Working with Virtual Machine

   - Lab8-Getting Started with App Engine

   - Lab9-Getting Started with Deployment Manager and Cloud Monitoring

   - Lab10- Getting Started with BigQuery

   - Lab11-Automating the Deployment of Infrastructure Using Deployment Manager

   - Lab12-Virtual Private Networks (VPN)

   can be assumed to not have been completed within the timeline of the program. This is because you cut out the date and/or time on which the completion emails were received from the screenshots you provided.
